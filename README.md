# A-Grots-Life 2 

A Survival / Crafting Game written using Tkinter and OOPS. 

Key features

-Crafting/Survival Mechanics 

-TKINTER GUI 

-Fetch quest generator 

-Hidden Gambling Den 

-Multiple Endings 


-All graphics created using GraphicsGale

This is a Tkinter version of 'A Grots Life' in my mini-game series with added crafting items and many new mechanics/features. 

Had to change some of the code before converting to EXE file  (instead of quit() had to use sys.exit) hence why there are two python files
(A grots life 2 is the original) 


-To play without python download all files and run the exe file.
