This is a Tkinter version of 'A Grots Life' in my mini-game series with added crafting items and many new mechanics/features. 

Had to change some of the code before converting to EXE file  (instead of quit() had to use sys.exit) hence why there are two python files
(A grots life 2 is the original) 


-To play without python download all files and run the exe file.
